# Project 2 Proposal: WORM

## Description

WORM is an application that allows users to search for books by entering a specific query (Title, Author, Exerpt, etc). The user then submits the query. This calls upon the Google Books API that will return an array of books with the corresponding data (Title, Author, Published Date, Picture, etc.) The user will be able to see the list of books on the page. Users can also save books to their own personal library.

## Potential Features

- Implement a Responsive Design/Image Processing
- Create a digital bookshelf where the user can add books to their shelf, rate them, create lists, and send them to other users via email
- Loading animations/pictures
- Require user authentication for saving books to library 
- For each item in the list add a link that will send the User to an external site which has more information about the book and/or create a popup with the book summary
